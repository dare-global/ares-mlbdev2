# Proposal Documents

When creating proposal documents (feature requests, design proposals, workflow improvements):

## Location

- **Always place proposals in the project root directory** (not in `docs/proposals/` or subdirectories)
- Example: `/project-root/MyProposal.md`

## Git Tracking

- **Proposals should stay local** - do not commit to git
- They are working documents meant for discussion, not version-controlled artifacts
- If a proposal is accepted, the implementation gets committed, not the proposal itself

## Naming

- Use descriptive names with the target system/component
- Example: `AlgoUtils-ReleaseWorkflow.md`, `RefDataService-CacheStrategy.md`

## Cleanup After Acceptance

When a proposal has been actioned (accepted and implemented):

1. **Verify** the implementation is complete and committed
2. **Delete** the proposal `.md` file from the project root
3. Proposals are transient working documents -- once the work is done, the code is the source of truth
